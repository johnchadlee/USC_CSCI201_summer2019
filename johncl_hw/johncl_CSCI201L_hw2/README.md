Note: sometimes when running "all" cities, it would print the output lines twice (like 6 lines instead of 3)
but I was able to easily fix this by rerunning the program. I wasn't sure how to fix it in my code / if there 
was anything to even fix so please just run it again if that happens and it should just print it once. Thanks!
